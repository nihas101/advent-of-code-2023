# Advent of Code 2023
A repository containing my solutions to the [Advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

## Requirements
The solutions are written in [Clojure](https://clojure.org). [Leningen](https://leiningen.org/) can be used to execute the code within this project to e.g. run tests on the solutions.

## Solutions
The solutions are located in `src/advent_of_code_2023/`. The solutions for day XY are found in file `dayXY.clj`. The corresponding tests are found in files named `test/advent_of_code_2023/dayXY_test.clj`. Input files are stored in `resources/dayXY.txt`
